# Image Generation with Stable Diffusion Model

## Overview
Imagine is an image generation system powered by the `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0` pre-trained model. It enables developers, designers, and content creators to effortlessly produce high-quality images from text inputs. By leveraging the power of Stable Diffusion, this system offers a seamless way to generate images that match user-described prompts.

### Intended Audience:
- Developers
- Designers
- Content creators

## Libraries and Frameworks

This project utilizes the following libraries and tools to build the image generation system:

- **diffusers**: Used to integrate the `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0` pre-trained model for high-quality image generation.
- **Flask**: Used to build the API that enables communication with the image generation model.
- **ngrok**: Used to expose the Flask API externally, making it accessible from anywhere.
- **torch**: The PyTorch framework, essential for running the `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0` model.
